Committed to solving the problem of transferring major and credits.

This project adopts the front and back end separate development. 

   The front-end adopts Vue, Vuex and other technical frameworks to realize a single page application 
in the background and a single page application in the foreground.

The core function of this project is the elective courses for students and the function for students to apply for cross-major study. 
Background management is also very important.
